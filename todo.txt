correct cw guidance so end point is determined
could not end last circ node
go over everything that is hardcoded

nodes:
    still warping before orientating
phasing
    problem with circularization burn? 
    problem if phasing calculations not based on target orbit
    r_bar distance at the end of phasing - the bigger the less precise 
docking
    making sure target points in right direction
    targetting the docking port
    controlling from docking port?

Future versions:
1. implement discrete pulse controlling
2. implement mission file following usual mission description protocol
