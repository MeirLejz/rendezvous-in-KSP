Rendezvous in KSP is a python program that implements satellite rendezvous and proximity operations strategies and algorithms inside the Kerbal Space Program game.

It uses kRPC (remote procedure calls for ksp) with the Python client.

The goal of this personnal project was to review known materials from my studies and software design skills and combine it in a fun way.

The program is still in development and several assumptions regarding the used spacecraft and initial conditions were made such that it might not generalize well for all uses.

Assumptions and how-to will be described here in the future.
